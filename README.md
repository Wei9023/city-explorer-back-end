# lab09-back-end
# City Explorer

**Author**: Vanessa Wei
**Version**: 4.0.0 

## Overview

I will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, I will request data from various third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In the later stages of this week's project I will be persisting data in a SQL database.

Each day of this project I and my pair-programming partner will deploy this back end app as a new instance on Heroku.

I will be hooking up the back-end app to the front-end code base for the client, but I will not be modifying the client-side code in any way.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

For this project I will be using the following technologies: 

* **Languages:** JavaScript, SQL
* **Libraries and frameworks:** jQuery, Handlebars.js, Node.js, Express, 
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Deployment platform:** Heroku
* **APIs:** Google Geocoding, Yelp, Dark Sky, The Movie DB
